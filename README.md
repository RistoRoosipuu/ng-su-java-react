# ng-su-java-react
Java assignment for the SU. Made using Spring and React.

# Instructions

- (Recommendation) Download the repository by using the cmd: git clone <repository location>
- Open in Intellij, import Maven dependencies. 
- **If you see a "can't find module error", please don't remove the module**
  
- Since the program uses React as the front-end part, navigate to /front-end folder on the cmd, write **"npm install"** 
- and **"npm start"** to
- install the necessary files and start up the front-end part. Don't forget to launch Spring for the back-end API :)
